# Guide
## Execution

To start the game, simply download the release and run the ".exe" file.
Alternatively, you can download the source code and compile it using Visual Studio (VS).

## History context
You are wandering through a wasteland, thirsty and with low oxygen levels...
Your objective is to find a source of water.
In the distance, you spot a cave and decide to enter.
Inside the cave, you discover an abandoned settlement.
You decide to explore and see if you find anything interesting.
> **Note:** You can't move too much! The oxygen depletes each time you move.

## Color guide
The game uses colors to distinguish elements, you can see these colors represented on the map too.

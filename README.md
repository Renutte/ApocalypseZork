# Guide
## Download and execution

To start the game, simply download [here](https://github.com/Renutte/ApocalypseZork/releases/tag/ApocalypseZork) the release and run the ".exe" file. <br>
Alternatively, you can download the [source code](https://github.com/Renutte/ApocalypseZork/releases/tag/ApocalypseZork) and compile it using Visual Studio (VS).

## History context

It is the year 2023. After a nuclear and biological war, the air has become unbreathable.<br>
You find yourself wandering through a desolate wasteland, thirsty and with your oxygen tank running low.<br>
Your objective is to find a source of water.<br>
In the distance, you spot a cave and decide to venture inside.<br>
As you explore, you discover an abandoned settlement and decide to check it out, hoping to find water.<br>

‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING: Movement consumes oxygen, don't waste it by exploring unnecessarily.<br>
> **Note:** You can't move too much! The oxygen depletes each time you move.

## Color guide
The game uses colors in the responses to differentiate between elements.

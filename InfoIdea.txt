=== INTRODUCTION:
    In a post-apocalyptic world, there is no drinkable water on the surface, and pure air is scarce. 
    The remaining humans on Earth must use oxygen tanks to breathe. 
    Oxygen depletes with movement.
    You are a survivor who stumbles upon the entrance to a cave, which appears to be a shelter. The cave is organized into rooms.

=== DESCRIPTION:
	Room* entrance = new Room("Entrance", "In east you have a rock you can push, in south a door with blue lock.");
	Room* main_room = new Room("Main room", "In west you have the entrance, in north entrance to a vault, in east a door with orange lock.");
	Room* oxygen_store = new Room("Oxygen store", "In north you have the entrance.");
	Room* switch_room = new Room("Switch room", "In west you have the main room.");
	Room* vault_entrance = new Room("Vault entrance", "In east you have a door with red lock, in south you have the main room.");
	Room* vault = new Room("Vault", "In west you have the vault entrance.");

	player = new Player("Explorer", "You are an explorer searching for water, your oxygen level is decreasing.", entrance);
